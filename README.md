# Multiplexed AI Text Generation with Distributed Sentiment Analysis

This project uses OpenAI api to generate a variety of responses to a given prompt, and then summarizes the responses based on sentiment analysis. The unique aspect of this project is the use of a populating matrix table to create a multi-layered, multiplexed response set by generating, weighting, and summarizing responses assigned to nodes. When considering both the content and sentiment of the responses and by propagating this sentiment across a table, the method ensures a final summary that is both comprehensive and nuanced.

## Sentiment Analysis:
This method does not just consider the literal content of each response, but also its sentiment. By calculating sentiment scores and using them to weight the responses, the final summary can more accurately reflect the overall sentiment of the responses. The sentiment of each response influences the weight of its neighboring cells in the table. This mechanism allows the sentiment of one cell to "spread" to its neighbors, leading to a more nuanced final summary that takes into account not only the content of the responses but also their sentiment.

## Diverse Responses: 
By using different temperature settings for each cell in the table, this method ensures a wide range of responses from the AI model. Lower temperatures yield more predictable, focused responses, while higher temperatures yield more creative, diverse responses. This variability is beneficial when you want a mixture of both predictable and innovative responses.

## Summary Generation:
The final summary response is generated by combining all responses in the table, taking into account their adjusted weights. In this way, the summary response is a weighted combination of all the original responses, where the weights are influenced by the sentiment scores of each response and its neighbors.
